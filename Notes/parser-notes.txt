We went through and removed most of the prior grammar before beginning the parser portion of the assignment. 
From there we used the BNF specification for MiniJava to construct our grammar.


We included code in our MiniJava file that takes the scanner information and puts it through the parser. And then 
it takes that parsers roots node and feeds it into our implementations for AST print and PrettPrintVisitor. 
We decided that including more than one visitor argument in the command to be an error, returning an exit status
of 1. Also, we did not add any language extensions.
