we tried to get as much of the compiler as we could get done.
we didn't have time to handle arrays. also, there was a considerable amount of time spent
going back and fixing the false positive/negatives in our error and semantic checks. this
time allocation partly explains why we didn't complete the entirety of the project, but we
did get close. we did emphasis fixing our error&semantics bugs because we did not want to
run assembly code on a file that has syntax errors.
